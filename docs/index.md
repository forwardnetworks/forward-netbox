# NetBox plugin Overview

The Forward Networks NetBox plugin enables data synchronization between Forward Networks and NetBox platforms. This plugin serves as a bridge between network discovery (Forward Networks) and source of truth (NetBox), allowing network engineers and operators to maintain a single source of truth for network infrastructure data.

## Key Features

### Data Synchronization
The plugin connects directly to the Forward Enterprise REST / NQE API, collecting structured network data from Forward Networks instances and transforming it to NetBox's data modelâ€”no additional Forward SDK is required.

### Branches
Built on [NetBox Branching](https://docs.netboxlabs.com/netbox-extensions/branching/) feature, the plugin allows review of proposed changes before they are applied to the production database, providing an additional layer of validation and control.

### Scheduled Operations
Administrators can configure automated, periodic synchronization jobs to ensure NetBox data remains current with the actual network state discovered by Forward Networks.

### Visual Differencing
The plugin provides visual differencing capabilities to easily identify changes between synchronization operations, making it simple to track network infrastructure evolution over time.

### Multiple Source Support
Connect to multiple Forward Networks instances simultaneously, allowing for comprehensive network visibility across different environments or network segments.

## Use Cases

- **Network Documentation Automation**: Automatically document network devices, interfaces, IP addresses, and VLANs discovered by Forward Networks
- **Configuration Validation**: Compare intended network state (NetBox) with actual state (Forward Networks)
- **Change Management**: Review and approve network changes through the staged changes workflow
- **Network Inventory Management**: Maintain accurate inventory of network devices and components
- **IP Address Management**: Synchronize IP address allocation and usage information

## NetBox Compatibility

The plugin requires specific NetBox versions due to API changes and feature dependencies. Please ensure compatibility before installation.

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version | Release Date | Key Notes                                      |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 4.4.0 and up   | 1.0.x          | 2025-10-13   | First public release, REST/NQE API integration |

## Important Notes

!!! danger "Installation Location"
    Integrations should be installed outside of the Forward Networks VM unless the Forward Networks
    Networks team explicitly instructs otherwise.

!!! warning "System Access"
    Any action on the Command-Line Interface (CLI) using the `root`, `osadmin`,
    or `autoboss` account may cause irreversible, detrimental changes to the
    product. Actions taken without direct communication with the Forward Networks
    Support or Solution Architect teams can render the system unusable.

## Screenshots from NetBox UI

### Image 1: Forward Networks Source Details
This image shows the details page for an Forward Networks source named `Forward Networks-Demo` in the NetBox interface. The page displays key configuration information including:

- Source type: `Local`
- Status: `New`
- URL: `https://demo2.eu.forward.io`
- Authentication credentials (masked with asterisks)
- Verification and timeout settings
- No tags or comments have been assigned
- The source was created and last updated on May 22, 2025

The left sidebar shows the hierarchical navigation menu for the NetBox interface with Forward Networks functionality integrated as a section. Action buttons at the top allow for syncing, bookmarking, subscribing, editing, or deleting the source.

### Image 2: Forward Networks Snapshots Management
This image displays the Forward Networks Snapshots management page, showing 6 snapshots from the Forward Networks-Demo source. The snapshots are listed chronologically with the following details:

- Name (mostly following `netlab - [snapshot type]` naming convention)
- Source (all from `Forward Networks Test`)
- Snapshot ID (unique identifiers)
- Status (`Loaded`/`Unloaded`)
- Date (ranging from April 2024 to July 2024)

The snapshots include various types such as `Post Change` and `Day 3`. Each snapshot has a delete option, and there's a `Delete Selected` button at the bottom for batch operations. The table is configurable and supports filtering and searching.

### Image 3: Forward Networks Sync Details
This image shows an active sync configuration named `FWD Demo2 Sync`. The page displays:

Sync information section showing:

- Name: `FWD Demo2 Sync`
- Source: `Forward Networks Test`
- Snapshot: `04-Jul-24 08:00:01`
- Status: `Syncing`
- Latest branch timestamp
- No schedule or interval set
- User: `netbox`

Parameters section listing various network elements being ingested:

- All key network parameters (VRF, site, vlan, device, etc.) are set to `True`
- Sites parameter shows an empty array `[]`
- Groups parameter is set to `['Debugging', 'Site A']` in this order

The page has action buttons for `Adhoc Ingestion`, `Edit`, and `Delete` operations. There are also tabs for `Forward Networks Sync`, `Tranform Maps`, `Ingestions`, and `Changelog` with job information.
