  # Forward Networks NetBox Plugin

  ## Forward Networks

  Forward Networks is a vendor-neutral network assurance platform that automates the
  holistic discovery, verification, visualization, and documentation of
  large-scale enterprise networks, reducing the associated costs and required
  resources whilst improving security and efficiency.

  It supports your engineering and operations teams, underpinning migration and
  transformation projects. Forward Networks will revolutionize how you approach network
  visibility and assurance, security assurance, automation, multi-cloud
  networking, and trouble resolution.

  **Integrations or scripts should not be installed directly on the Forward Networks VM unless directly communicated from the
  Forward Networks Support or Solution Architect teams. Any action on the Command-Line Interface (CLI) using the root, osadmin,
  or autoboss account may cause irreversible, detrimental changes to the product and can render the system unusable.**

  ## Overview

  This plugin allows the integration and data synchronization between Forward Networks and NetBox.

  It uses Forward's Network Query Engine (NQE) to gather structured intent-based data directly from your modeled network,
  and uses NetBoxâ€™s Staged Changes and Background Tasks capabilities to safely sync that data into NetBox.

  - Multiple Forward Networks Sources
  - Scheduled Ingestion (Adhoc or Periodic)
  - Full Snapshot View
  - Diff and Job Logging Views
  - Topology Buttons and Detail View Integration
